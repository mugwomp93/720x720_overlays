A collection of completed and in progress 720x720 overlays for the RG CubeXX and other devices. Tested on muOS Pixie.

I plan to upload overlays as they're completed or as I lose motivation to work on them. Anything that falls into the latter category will be marked as a work in progress (WIP) in the descriptions below. I won't upload anything I wouldn't use myself, but that last 10% is usually the most tedious part and this is something I do for fun. I normally wouldn't upload anything that wasn't completed, but from what I've seen there aren't yet many options for 720x720 overlays (the ones I have seen are high quality; there just aren't many of them), especially non-integer scale options, and I don't have any particular timelines for revisiting these.

## 1playerinsertcoin Blank Pack
As you may have noticed from the descriptions above, 1playerinsertcoin has been very generous with their time in creating overlays for a device they don't even own. Given how long it takes to create high quality overlays, limited free time, etc, I thought it would be unfair to keep these to myself until I was done creating my versions. I'm providing the bare overlays (no border decorations, shadows, etc) in a single zip file without instructions, but the individual overlays have descriptive names and, unlike my versions, should all be centered. If you use these to create your own versions, please credit 1playerinsertcoin if you decide to share them.

Overlays in the bundle include:
- GBC 4x integer
- GBC non-integer (720x648)
- GBA 3x integer
- GG 4x integer (720x648; square pixels)
- GG 4:3
- NGPC 4x integer
- NGPC non-integer (720x684)
- PICO-8 non-integer (720x720)
